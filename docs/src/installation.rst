Installation
============

scikit-matter is, by design, relatively lightweight, and only requires the most recent
release of `scikit-learn <scikit-learn.org>`_ be installed.

Install from source
###################

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/lab-cosmo/scikit-matter
  cd scikit-matter
  pip install .

Alternatively, if you don't have special privileges, install
the package using the ``--user`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install . --user

You're ready to import skmatter from your code! Have a look at the :ref:`api-reference`
for how to use the code.
